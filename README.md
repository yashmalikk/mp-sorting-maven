Description of custom sorting algorithm


My sorting algorithm is in a way polymorphic, it works in the following steps:

1st: It checks every element of the array with the next and sees how many elements are out of order in this sense

2nd: Depending on how "relatively sorted" the list is it decides which sorting algorithm to implement. 

Thus, no actual difference in the sorting algorithm is unique, it is just an amalgamation of many sorting algorithms.
